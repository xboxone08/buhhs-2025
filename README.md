### Rishit Avadhuta, Medhansh Choudhury

A project for the BUHHS 2025 hackathon. Contains a python script to notify the user when they are charging their laptop/device with non-clean energy and encourages them to delay their charging until they can charge with more sustainable sources, thus saving CO2 while still maintaining a charge. Works cross-platform.
